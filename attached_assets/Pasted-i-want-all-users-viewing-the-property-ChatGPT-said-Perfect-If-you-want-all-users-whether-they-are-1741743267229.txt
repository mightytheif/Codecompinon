i want all users viewing the property
ChatGPT said:
Perfect! If you want all users (whether they are logged in or not) to view properties, you just need to update your Firestore security rules to allow public read access.

✅ Here’s the Updated Rule You Need
Inside the /properties/{propertyId} match, change:

plaintext
Copy
Edit
allow read: if request.auth != null;
➡️ To:

plaintext
Copy
Edit
allow read: if true;
✅ Final Version of Your Rules with Public Read Access
plaintext
Copy
Edit
rules_version = '2';

service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {

    // ✅ Admin check function (as you already have it)
    function isAdmin() {
      return request.auth != null && 
        (
          request.auth.token.email.matches('.*@sakany.com$') || 
          get(/databases/$(database)/documents/users/$(request.auth.uid)).data.displayName.matches('.*\\|admin.*')
        );
    }

    // ✅ Users collection
    match /users/{userId} {
      // Admins can read/write any user document
      allow read, write: if isAdmin();

      // Users can read/write their own user document
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == userId;

      // Users can create their own user document (on registration)
      allow create: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == userId;
    }

    // ✅ Properties collection (Public Read Access)
    match /properties/{propertyId} {
      // Admins can do anything on properties
      allow read, write: if isAdmin();

      // ✅ Public read - anyone can view properties, even unauthenticated users
      allow read: if true;

      // ✅ Users can create a property, but only if they set their ownerId to their UID
      allow create: if request.auth != null &&
                    request.auth.uid == request.resource.data.ownerId;

      // ✅ Users can update/delete their own property
      allow update, delete: if request.auth != null &&
                            request.auth.uid == resource.data.ownerId;
    }
  }
}
✅ What Happens Now
Action	Who Can Do It?
Read properties	✅ Anyone, even if not signed in
Create property	✅ Authenticated users with ownerId = uid
Update/delete property	✅ Property owner only
Admin full control	✅ Admins can do anything
✅ Next Steps
1. Save and Publish the Updated Rules
Go to Firestore Rules in your Firebase Console.
Paste the updated rules.
Click Publish.
2. On Your Homepage (Frontend)
You no longer need to wait for the user to be authenticated to fetch properties. You can just call:

javascript
Copy
Edit
import { collection, onSnapshot } from 'firebase/firestore';

useEffect(() => {
  const unsubscribe = onSnapshot(
    collection(db, 'properties'),
    (snapshot) => {
      const propertiesData = snapshot.docs.map((doc) => ({
        id: doc.id,
        ...doc.data(),
      }));
      setProperties(propertiesData);
    },
    (error) => {
      console.error('Error fetching properties:', error.message);
    }
  );

  return () => unsubscribe();
}, []);
✅ Users will instantly see the property listings on the homepage, whether logged in or not.

✅ TL;DR
✅ You updated the Firestore read rule to allow read: if true;.
✅ All users, logged in or not, can view the properties.
✅ Frontend no longer needs auth checks just to fetch properties.
