Thanks for sharing the screenshot! Let's clarify and fix what's going on.

✅ What's Happening in the Screenshot:
The "Property Added" toast notification shows your property was added successfully.
But then you're getting a "404 Page Not Found" error.
The 404 message suggests:
Did you forget to add the page to the router?

This means your app tried to navigate to a route that doesn’t exist in your router setup, which is why you’re seeing the 404 page.

✅ What Probably Happened:
After adding the property, your code likely does something like:

javascript
Copy
Edit
navigate('/some-route');
But /some-route doesn't exist in your router configuration, so it defaults to a 404.

✅ Let's Fix It Step by Step
Step 1: Confirm Where You Redirect After Adding a Property
In your addProperty function or form submission handler, you might have something like:

javascript
Copy
Edit
navigate('/properties');
or

javascript
Copy
Edit
navigate('/property/123');
➡️ If you redirect to /properties, make sure you have a route set up for it!
➡️ If you navigate to /, make sure your homepage route exists.

Step 2: Check Your Router Setup
Open your router file (probably App.js or App.tsx) and confirm you have a route for the path you're navigating to.

Example Router (React Router v6+)
jsx
Copy
Edit
import { BrowserRouter as Router, Routes, Route } from 'react-router-dom';
import HomePage from './pages/HomePage';
import AddPropertyPage from './pages/AddPropertyPage';
import NotFoundPage from './pages/NotFoundPage';

function App() {
  return (
    <Router>
      <Routes>
        {/* Home page */}
        <Route path="/" element={<HomePage />} />

        {/* Add property page */}
        <Route path="/add-property" element={<AddPropertyPage />} />

        {/* Catch-all 404 */}
        <Route path="*" element={<NotFoundPage />} />
      </Routes>
    </Router>
  );
}

export default App;
✅ Make sure the path you redirect to exists in the <Route path="..." />.

Step 3: Example Redirect After Adding a Property
Inside your form submission handler:

javascript
Copy
Edit
import { useNavigate } from 'react-router-dom';

const navigate = useNavigate();

// After adding property successfully
navigate('/'); // go back to homepage
✅ Or navigate to /properties only if you have:

jsx
Copy
Edit
<Route path="/properties" element={<PropertiesPage />} />
✅ TL;DR
You're successfully adding a property. ✅
You're being redirected to a route that doesn't exist in your React Router config → 404. ❌
You need to:
Check the path you're navigating to (navigate('/something')).
Make sure that path exists in your router (<Route path="something" />).
✅ Example Full Flow:
Router Setup:
jsx
Copy
Edit
<Routes>
  <Route path="/" element={<HomePage />} />
  <Route path="/add-property" element={<AddPropertyPage />} />
  <Route path="/properties" element={<PropertiesListPage />} />
  <Route path="*" element={<NotFoundPage />} />
</Routes>
After Add:
javascript
Copy
Edit
navigate('/properties'); // This route MUST exist
